# Day 20 - Building the Snake Game (Part 1)

### Concepts Learned: 

Today I started building the classic Snake Game using Python and Turtle graphics, applying all the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts I’ve learned so far. The focus was on:
- Structuring the game using custom classes
- Creating the initial snake body with three segments
- Animating the snake’s movement
- Implementing keyboard controls to change direction (up, down, left, right)

This was the first of a two-part project. Tomorrow, I’ll continue developing the game by adding food, score tracking, and collision detection. Super fun and nostalgic project—can’t wait to finish it!
