- **Concepts Learned**: Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope.

## Project 1: Pizza Deliveries

### How It Works

1. The program first prompts the user to select the size of pizza they want.
2. Then, the user is asked if they want pepperoni on their pizza.
3. Next, the user is asked if they want extra cheese.
4. The program calculates the order's total, based on the users preferences.
5. Finally, the result is printed in the terminal.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python pizza_deliveries.py
```

### Example

```
Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries!
What size pizza do you want? S, M or L: M
Do you want pepperoni on your pizza? Y or N: Y
Do you want extra cheese? Y or N: Y
Your final bill is: $24.00.
```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x


## Project 2: Treasure Island

This is an interactive text-based adventure game. You're asked to select one of the two options, and the choice you make can either lead you to a trap or move you one step forward to the discovery of the hidden treasure.

### How to play

1. **Start the game**: You begin by choosing a direction at a crossroad.
2. **Make decisions**: Throughout the game, you'll face choices, such as which way to turn, whether to swim or walk, and which entrance to choose.
3. **Watch out for consequences**: Every decision has consequences, and sometimes you might find yourself in a dangerous situation leading to a "Game Over."

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python treasure_island_game.py
```

### Example

```
Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.
You're at a cross roads. Which turn do you take? (Type "left" or "right"):
left
You've entered an enchanted forest. There's a lake ahead of you. Do you swim across or walk around the lake? (Type "swim" or "walk"):
swim
You've successfully swum across the lake and come across a small hut. Which entrance do you choose? (Type "front door", "side window" or "chimney"):
side window
You sneak past the wicked witch and find the hidden treasure. You win!
```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- These are some of the earliest projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
