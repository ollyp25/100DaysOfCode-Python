# Day 18 - Graphical User Interface (GUI), Turtle Graphics & Module Imports

### Concepts Learned: 

On Day 18 I explored Python’s turtle module to create graphical art using code. I also learned about tuples and how to better manage and import Python modules. The final project was a fun, creative exercise: generating randomized dot-style artwork inspired by Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings.

## Project of the Day
- [Hirst Painting](Day18/main.py)

### How It Works

This program uses Python’s turtle module to generate a 10x10 grid of colored dots, inspired by Damien Hirst's spot paintings. A turtle named Timmy places randomly colored dots from a predefined palette. After drawing each row, Timmy moves up to start the next, creating a full grid of evenly spaced dots. The screen stays open until clicked.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python main.py
```

### Example

```

```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is one of the earliest projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
