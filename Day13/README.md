### Concepts Learned: 
This day was dedicated to learning all about debugging aka the process of removing bugs from your code. 
I was taught:
- How to read error messages 
- How to use print() function to identify issues

## Project of the Day 
No project for today but I had the opportunity to practice learned concepts by completing a few simple exercises.
