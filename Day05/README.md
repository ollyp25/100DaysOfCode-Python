# Day 5 - Intro to Python Loops

### Concepts Learned: 
- Python For Loops
- range() function

## Project of the Day - Password Generator

### How It Works

1. User Input: The program prompts the user to specify how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
2. Password Generation: Based on the user's input, the program randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.
3. Shuffling: The characters are shuffled to ensure randomness and security.
4. Password Output: The generated password is printed.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python password_generator.py
```

### Example

```
Welcome to the Python Password Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password? 10
How many symbols would you like? 5
How many numbers would you like? 3
2i3l3T)f+Gg#e)cvW)
```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is one of the earliest projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
