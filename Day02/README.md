# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

- **Concepts Learned**: basic Python syntax (variables, data types, operators, type conversion and f-strings).

## Project of the Day - Tip Calculator

A simple Python program that calculates each person's share (tip included) when splitting the restaurant bill among multiple people.

### How It Works

1. Input the bill total.
2. Input the tip percentage.
3. Input the number of people splitting the bill.
4. The program will calculate the total including the tip and divide it by the number of people.
5. The final result gets printed, formatted to two decimal points.

### Usage

To run the program, clone the repo and execute the following command:

```
python tip_calculator.py
```

### Example

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What's the bill total? $ 100
What percentage would you like to tip? 15
How many people are splitting the bill? 4
Each person should pay $28.75
```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is one of the early projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
