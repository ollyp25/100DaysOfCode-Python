# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

- **Concepts Learned**: basic Python concepts (printing, inputting, commenting, string manipulation).

## Project of the Day - Band Name Generator

This is a fun and simple Python program that helps you create a unique band name by combining the name of your hometown and your pet's name.

### How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input their hometown.
2. Then, the user is asked for their pet's name.
3. The program combines these two inputs to generate a potential band name.
4. Finally, the program prints the result.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python band_name_generator.py
```

### Example

```
Welcome to the Band Name Generator!
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> Seattle
What's your pet's name?
> Luna
Your band name could be: Seattle Luna
```

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is the very first project I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
