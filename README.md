# 100 Days Of Code - Python Bootcamp 

Welcome to my repository for the **100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp** challenge! This repository contains my study logs and all the projects I’ve completed as part of this Udemy course. Each folder in this repository contains information about the concepts I learned that day of the challenge, as well as one or more mini-projects I have worked on.

## About the 100 Days of Code challenge
   This coding challenge is about committing myself to code for at least an hour each day to increase my knowledge of Python gradually. Each day I focus on learning new syntax and concepts of Pythion (plus its various libraries) and applying them through hands-on projects.

## Projects Overview
Below is an overview of the different days and projects that are part of this repository:

### Day 6 - Python Functions & Karel
- No project for Day 6

### Day 5 - For Loops
- **Project of the Day**: [Password Generator](Day05/password_generator.py)

### Day 4 - Random Module
- **Project of the Day**: [Rock Paper Scissors](Day04/rock_paper_scissors.py)

### Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators
- **Projects of the Day**:
  - [Pizza Delivery Program](Day03/pizza_deliveries.py)
  - [Treasure Island Game](Day03/treasure_island_game.py)

### Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings
- **Project of the Day**: [Tip Calculator](Day02/tip_calculator.py)

### Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python
- **Project of the Day**: [Band Name Generator](Day01/band_name_generator.py)


## Technologies Used
- All of these projects are written in **Python 3**.
- **IDEs**: I use PyCharm to write and run the code.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and sharing my progress.

## Future Enhancements
As I progress through the 100 Days of Code challenge, I will update the repository and add more advanced projects. I will also start incorporating more advanced concepts, libraries, and frameworks into my code.

- Add advanced features like input validation, error handling, and enhanced user interfaces.
- Explore web development with Flask.
- Integrate APIs and explore real-world applications.
