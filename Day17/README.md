# Day 17 - OOP and Custom Classes

### Concepts Learned: 

On Day 17 I learned how to create custom classes from scratch using Object-Oriented Programming. I applied this by building a True/False quiz game, where I used my own classes to manage questions, user interaction, and scoring. The project reinforced how to structure and use objects effectively in a real-world program.

## Project of the Day
- [Quiz Project](Day17/main.py)

### How It Works

The program uses OOP to build a quiz game. It converts raw question data into Question objects and stores them in a question_bank. The QuizBrain class manages quiz logic, presenting each question and checking answers. The game continues until all questions are answered, then displays the userâ€™s final score.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python main.py
```

### Example

```
Q.1: The NVidia GTX 1080 gets its name because it can only render at a 1920x1080 screen resolution. (True or False?): False

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is one of the earliest projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program, for example, by adding more advanced features like input validation, dynamic tip percentages, or a graphical user interface (GUI).
