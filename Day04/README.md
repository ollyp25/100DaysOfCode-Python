# Day 4 - Randomisation and Python Lists

### Concepts Learned: 
- Python lists 
- Python Random Module

## Project of the Day - Rock Paper Scissors

### How It Works

1. User Input: The game asks the user to choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
2. Computer Selection: The computer randomly picks one of the three choices.
3. Comparison: The program compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner based on the rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
4. Outcome: The result is displayed as either a win, lose, or draw. Both the player's and the computer's choices are shown as ASCII art.

### Usage

To run the program, execute the script in your Python environment:

```
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

### Example

```
Make your choice: Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors 0

    _______
---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)

Computer chose:

    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
          _______)
         _______)
---.__________)

You lose :(

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

### Notes

- This is one of the earliest projects I completed during the **100 Days of Code** Python Bootcamp on Udemy.
- Feel free to modify the program by adding more advanced features.
